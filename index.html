    <h4 id="about-me">Short Bio</h4>
    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>I am Musiimenta Racheal, an aspiring Software Engineer from Rukungiri. I am 18 years old and currently a first-year, second-semester student at the Uganda National Institute of Information and Communications Technology. With a passion for software engineering and programming, I aspire to become a software engineer.</p>
    <p>My journey into this exciting field began in Senior One at Ntungamo High School, where I fell in love with ICT. I continued with it through Senior Four and have since been inspired by the incredible benefits technology offers.</p>
    <p>I thrive on exploring how technology can simplify and enhance our daily lives. I’m particularly interested in web development, mobile application design, and emerging fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning. I find joy in learning about new tools and frameworks, as they allow me to experiment and grow as a developer.</p>
    <p>Beyond technology, I believe in the power of community and storytelling. I enjoy mentoring younger students, sharing my experiences, and encouraging more young people to explore ICT. I aspire to make a positive impact through innovation and creativity.</p>
